At first I chose this program because I wanted to persue my career in Med, but after a while I found myself very interested with tech and programming. Therefore, I decided to try this course out to see if I should continue my career in Computer Sciences instead.");

One of my favourite Kpop group is BTS, I am a huge fan of them and their music is really inspiring! They have a huge impact on my life! I suggest checking out their music. Other than music and shows I like to draw, cook, bake, play games and talk to others online. I love exploring and learning new things.");
